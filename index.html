            Hello everyone, my name is Hannah. I made this portfolio to share some things about myself to you. I am currently making goals for myself and working towards them. I like to keep myself busy by working, giving time to my family, and going to the gym.
            There are many goals that I would like to achieve throughout my life. I want to learn more and be able to love what I do each and every day. I have begun working toward many of my goals by looking into a career change and thinking about what I think best fits me.
            </p>
            <p>
            One major goal I would like to accomplish in the next few years is getting a better job. My plan to get a better job is to finish learning, prepare a great resume, and looking into jobs. 
            In my spare time theres a lot I like to do such as painting, reading, watching movies, and getting work done. I want to start traveling soon and be able to explore the world while I'm still young. I do believe if I can truly focus on something I find interesting I will certainly succeed in attaining my goals.
            </p>
